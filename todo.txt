TODOS: 
- make error alert for user if not have location on deals and locations and buisnesses

- any page with user (location not found alert and disable)

- location based search on location maps + remove name based search? (test before remove) 

- location based search on buisness

- side nav external urls (rate)

NEXT STEPS:

DO RIGHT NOW:

- remove console logs
- minor CSS changes based on FIGMA design
- update marker design on locations page


- sign up page (location not found alert and disable)
- make custom location for sign up (Google Places Autocomplete on an ion-input)
- enter search location for locations page
